#  Disaster Prediction and Classification
This project presents a deep learning-based solution for disaster prediction, classification, and damage assessment using satellite imagery. It leverages MobileNetV2, a lightweight and efficient transfer learning model, to perform multi-class classification of different disaster types such as floods, Hurracains and many more.In addition to classification, the system also predicts a damage score using a custom linear regression head, providing a numerical estimate of the disaster's impact severity. The pipeline includes preprocessing, augmentation, and efficient model deployment, making it suitable for real-time or large-scale analysis tasks in disaster response systems.

# Key Features:
Transfer Learning with MobileNetV2 for efficient and accurate classification

1)  Damage Score Prediction using a linear regression layer

2) Supports both multi-class classification and regression

3) Data augmentation for better generalization on limited satellite data

4) Optimized for real-time inference and low-latency performance
